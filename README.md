# Measuring Heritage Emotions

This project uses Python, DLib, OpenCV and Facial Landmarks to recognize emotions from images/videos.

# Motivation

According to Waag Society and the Research Group Crossmedia, recent studies have shown that
young adults (<21) are hard to reach when it comes down to (cultural) heritage. In particular Waag
Society is researching how cultural heritage institutions can connect to these groups and how heritage
objects can be relevant to (young) people. Both parties believe that a better understanding of the
emotions people have, is very important to learn more about the way people value cultural heritage.
Therefore, Waag Society and the Research Group Crossmedia asked students of the HvA to design
an interactive tool that captures young adultsâ€™ emotions and enables them to discuss these emotions
with their peers when looking at (cultural) heritage.
